		<p> A good paragraph is composed of a topic sentence (or key sentence), relevant supporting sentences, and a closing (or transition) sentence. This structure is key to keeping your paragraph focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image.

		While creative writing does not necessarily follow the traditional paragraph structure, itâ€™s more about scene building and continuing a narrative. Efficient, well-written paragraphs are a staple of good flash fiction and short fiction writing, as short stories need to stay more focused on a central idea. As long as your sentences form cohesive ideas and connect to one another, you can write a good paragraph. </p>




		<p> Story theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of story. It is derived from observation of, and involves hypothetical speculation about how writers make stories. In other words, story theory is all about analyzing the existing body of literature to find its patterns and rhythms. </p> 



		<p id="Luffy"> Luffy receives Shanks' straw hat. Shanks is an Emperor, the captain of the Red Hair Pirates, and a former member of the Roger Pirates. Luffy first met Shanks in his hometown of Foosha Village when he was seven years old. The two get on extremely well and have equal intrigue and admiration for one another. </p>



		<p class="SHANKS"> Shanks Red-Haired Shanks is a legendary and powerful pirate in the Grand Line, being the captain of the Red Haired Pirate Crew and one of the Four Emperors in the second half of the grand line. </p>



		<p class="SHANKS"> Luffy is capable of retracting his arms and legs inside of his body, unleashing blows of devastating power, as well as being able to change the direction of his attacks. His defense also increases, with most attacks bouncing off his body. </p>


		<p> Death note is an AMAZING anime to binge-watch. Honestly, you'll love the characters and how insanely smart each one is. Light Yagami and L are two of the most loved & smartest fictional characters, hands down. Although, after a while you'll get pretty bored (spoiler!!) and think of dropping the series. </p>


		<p> One Punch Man is one of the funniest and most entertaining anime series I've ever watched in my entire life. Even though it is a newly started anime, the first episode was highly anticipated throughout the anime community, and it was definitely golden in my eyes, with high quality animations and a hilarious story line. </p>


		<p> Bleach has some fantastic arcs, but the anime constantly stalls its momentum through filler arcs that are not only excessive but tend to be of pretty low quality. </p>

		<p> Zoro's left eye has glown multiple times throughout the series, most prominently during the Water 7 saga. In fact, Zoro not opening his eye could be him successfully controlling the power and surge of the demon Asura, which he couldn't before. </p>
